	<div class="block">My life got twist-turned upside down</div>
	<div class="block">And I'd like to take a minute and sit right there</div>
	<div class="block">And tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</div>
	<div class="block">In West Philadelphia born and raised</div>
	<div class="block">On the playground was where I spent most of my days</div>
	<div class="block">Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool</div>
	<div class="block">And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school</div>
	<div class="block">When a couple of guys who were up to no good</div>
	<div class="block">Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood</div>
	<div class="block">I got in one lil' fight and my mom got scared</div>
	<div class="block">She said "you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</div>
	<div class="block">I whistled for a cab and when it came near</div>
	<div class="block">The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror</div>
	<div class="block">If anything I can say, this cab is rare</div>
	<div class="block">But I thought, naw, forget it, "yo homes, to Bel-Air"</div>
	<div class="block">I pulled up to the house about seven or eight</div>
	<div class="block">And I yelled to the cab "yo homes, smell ya later"</div>
	<div class="block">I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there</div>
	<div class="block">To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</div>
